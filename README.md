# myProject-2
An interactive frontend that showcases a free public API. I'll use the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data for any location around the world. We'll fetch the data, display a list of cities, and when a user clicks on a city, a detailed view of the weather will be shown. For this example, I'll use a structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
